## Overworld debug camera

Besides enabling debug camera when entering a cutscene\
there is also a way of activating through the developer menu\
by pressing the upper left of the touchpad and navigating:\
[SYSTEM]-->[MoveMapStep]-->Toggle Pause:On.

## Character debug dash

Activating debug dash by pressing L3 button\
increases the entity animation by five times\
as well as granting the ability to increase with\
L2 or decrease with L1 the current altitude.

## Entity manipulation

Taking control over an entity can be achieved by pressing\
the R3 button while L3 restores controls of the initial entity.

## Known Issues

Should be mentioned for your own sanity to make sure of turning off the lock-on and\
lock on target from the options menu to prevent passing back and forth of controls.\
Additionally do not wander too far from your default entity or you will get despawned.
